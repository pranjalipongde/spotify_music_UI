# Music Player Application

## Description

This project is a responsive music player application. It features an interactive user interface with smooth transitions and animations. The application allows users to browse, search, and play songs. It adapts to both small and large screens, providing an optimal user experience across all devices.

## Features

- Responsive design: The application adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- Interactive interface: Smooth animations and transitions enhance user experience.
- Song browsing: Users can filter songs by categories and search for specific tracks.
- Play and control: Users can play, pause, and navigate between tracks.
- Dynamic background: The background color changes based on the currently playing song.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: Front-end library for building the user interface.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for API requests.
- React Icons: Icon library for including various icons in the application.

## What I Learned

- Implementing responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.
- Using React hooks to manage state and side effects.
- Fetching data from an API and handling asynchronous operations.
- Creating smooth animations and transitions to enhance user experience.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [GitHub URL]
   cd music-player-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the application in your browser:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Note

The API did not provide the duration for the songs, so this information is not displayed in the UI.
